# Quantclean ðŸ§¹

A program that **reformats** every financial dataset to **US Equity TradeBar** (Quantconnect format)

## How to use it? ðŸš€

First, download the quantclean.py file in the folder where you are working

Note : I took this data from Quandl, your dataset doesn't have to look like this one necessarily, quantclean adapts to your dataset as well as possible

```
from quantclean import sweeps

df = pd.read_csv('AS-N100.csv')
df
```

```
_df = sweeps(df)
_df
```
